        <p>Pho Tay Ho originally opened in 1995 and was located on the first floor of an apartment complex.The owner, Mai,
        created a menu that was very simple, but focused. Appetizers included fried eggrolls,steamed eggrolls, and vermicelli noodles.
        The main entree was Pho, a dish unique to the Vietnamese culture,consisting of rice noodles, vegetables, and cuts of beef.
        She chose to specialize on this dish for three reasons: it was healthy, it was delicious, and it could be reasonably priced for customers.

        including the fresh Spring Rolls, the Vietnamese salad, and most notably â€“ the Chicken and Vegetarian Pho.
